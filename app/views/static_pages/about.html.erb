  RSVP is a real-time information network that connects you to the latest events and news about the UConn Community. Simply find the accounts you find most compelling and follow the User for updates and upcoming events.

At the heart of RSVP are small bursts of information called Shout. Each Shout is 140 characters long, but don’t let the small size fool you—you can discover a lot in a little space. You can see photos, videos and conversations directly in Shouts to get the whole story at a glance, and all in one place.
